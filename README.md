# Google Cloud Platform PhysioNet Data

The repository for creating, configuring, and distributing table-based
PhysioNet datasets on GCP. Forked from: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/healthcare

The main changes/additions are in the `datathon/organizer` subdirectory
which seek to clarify the structure of uploading the datasets. See its
`README.md` file.
